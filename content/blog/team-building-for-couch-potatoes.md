Team building trip. The words sent a chilling shudder down my spine. My mind generally works at a leisurely pace but suddenly it was racing.
“Please don’t let it be paintballing”,  
“Please don’t let it be far away”,  
“How early will I have to wake up?”,  
“How late will I get home?”,  
“What will the food be like?”.  
I may sound grumpy but I’ve built a nice little routine in my life and I don’t like interruptions to that routine. Akshay and Luigi told me they want to be out somewhere in nature, so I go on Google maps and search for green places. Turns out the entire country is green.

We agreed on the Cotswolds and I agreed to drive. So the day arrives and Akshay, Luigi, Giorgio and I are on the M40. The road is clear and I am happy there are no roadworks to slow us down. Akshay, however, is not happy. He wants to take the small, country roads the entire way. This is one of the few times I put my foot down and refuse when my boss asks me to do something. The Cotswolds is two hours away on the motorway. I had to tell him I am not adding a few extra hours to the journey time.
“We’ll take a few country roads when we get close” I tell him. Like promising a child an ice cream if he shuts up.

We arrived at Stow-on-the-Wold, after driving along some small country roads. Luigi looked around and sniffed the air “no river, no lake, no mountains. This place is useless”. So there we are. On Google maps. Looking for bodies of water in nearby towns. We settle on Bourton-on-the-Water and off we go again. When we arrive I start to feel more relaxed. It’s a cute little town with a stream running through it. The water attracted a lot of people on such a warm day and their happiness was becoming quite infectious. A pub lunch also helped my mood. I was starting to enjoy myself while we discussed what to do next.

It was time to get serious with the team building, it was time to hike. I found out quite a lot about my team that day. I discovered Akshay is an avid bird watcher and was carrying a lens that weighed as much as a small child, Luigi regularly hikes up the alps and jogs back down, Giorgio was a scout master and I need to do some cardio. While the others hadn’t broken a sweat I was ready to puke up my lunch. Even though I was suffering, I was trying to control my breathing so the others wouldn’t notice how difficult I was finding the hills. My poker face wasn’t as good as I’d hoped because Akshay asked me several times if I was ok.

To my surprise, the day turned out to be a really good one. The team building must have worked because the drive home was a lot livelier. The topics we talked about covered everything other than work and the mood in the office has been more relaxed. I had a huge, fiery debate with Akshay about fate and the effect our decisions have on our lives. Luigi and Giorgio were in the back seat, laughing at us. Each time we started to calm down, one of them would say something to get us started again. We would not be able to raise our voices like that in the office. Even now, several days after the trip, I’m learning new things about the people I work with. I always thought Giorgio was just a pretty boy with piercing blue eyes, but it turns out he is a hard-core camper, camping out up mountains during snow storms. We’ve been promised another team building trip and I am counting down the days. It’ll be bigger and better and I’ll write all about it once I’m back On what other day can I yell at my boss to “shut up” and get away with it?
