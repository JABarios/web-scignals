## Introduction

TODO Add some image

A few months back I started a fantastic journey by diving into Virtual Reality. It happened quite casually, I was peacefully minding my how business when someone putted a VR headset in my hands. I don't recall where it happened, probably at a meetup. But I do recall that the first think I thought was “Wow, this is awesome!”, which also happen to be the second and third thinks I thought. Actually I still think that way right now. Based on this I started to wonder “Maybe I could be part of this awesomeness?” which quickly became a “Yes I can!” (I definitely didn't stole that quotation from a famous personality... maybe). So I started to read what I could find about VR, including the various headsets of the moment. And the [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/ "Cardboard") looked like the perfect tool for the beginner I was. It's totally inexpensive, easy to carry around and still produce good results, exactly what you need to start playing around! So I took a look at the API and several SDK were available, one for Android, one for IOS and one for [Unity](https://unity3d.com/ "Unity"). The latest caught my attention, I had already tested Unity about two weeks ago and had loved the experience. That's when the picture got clearer: VR = awesome, Unity = awesome, so VR + Unity  = double awesome! That's where my journey started, and from there it only got awesomer (yes, it's so awesomingly awesoming that I need to create new words to carry the awesomishness)!
